        <h2>My life hasn't finished so far, this website will be updated when i die, so you will know</h2>
        <h2>When i was young, i was stupid, so now i am grown and still stupid. As russians say <i>stability is the
            attribute of mastery</i>. </h2>
        <h2>Now i learn in school. I have problems with informatics there, so i am making this website to let my teacher
            know that i am not a <font color=red>dumbass</font></h2>
        <h1>Fun facts about me</h1>

        <h2>2.I remember every meme i saw for last several years but i don't remember how old is my mother </h2>
        <h2>3.Once i told a joke, but nobody laughed, so i said, that it is called "meme', that is how memes were
            invented</h2>
        <h2>4.All my peers already know, what uni they are going to go after school and i still don't know which color
            is my favorite (i think red tbh)</h2>
        <h1>Not really fun facts about me</h1>
        <h2>1. My life is a joke, so all facts about it are fun. For example i don't eat chocolate cause i am afraid
            that it might be not a chocolate, you know...</h2>
